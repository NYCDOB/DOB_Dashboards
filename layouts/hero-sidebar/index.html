            The greatest year-to-year increase in total initial and renewed permits occurred from 2003 to 2004.  During that time New Building permits increased by 20% and Demolitions increased by 27%.  This upward surge in permitting activity continued through 2005, but was followed by a six year period of declining New Building and Demolition permits which both dropped almost 70%.  However, since 2013, New Building and Demolition permits have again steadily increased by 40%. The overwhelming majority of permits issued since 2000 are for ALT 2 permits which are for minor alterations in which the use or occupancy of a facility does not change.
